# Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning models to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset
to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Performance comparison
5. Feature importance analysis
6. ROC curve visualization

## Results
- Random Forest achieved higher accuracy compared to Logistic Regression.
- Feature importance highlights the most influential diagnostic features.

## Technologies
- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
